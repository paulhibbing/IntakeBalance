`IntakeBalance` is designed to facilitate energy intake calculations using the
intake-balance method, especially when research-grade accelerometry devices are
being used for the requisite energy expenditure calculations.

## Installation

You can install the development version of IntakeBalance from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("paulhibbing/IntakeBalance")
```

## Vignette

See [paulhibbing.com/IntakeBalance](https://paulhibbing.com/IntakeBalance). The rest of the website
is in hideous condition, especially for mobile users. So just ignore that, and laugh to yourself at
Dr. Hibbing's ineptitude.
